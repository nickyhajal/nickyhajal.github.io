SUBLETTING OUR PLACE IN AUSTIN: August and September

# 2br/2ba house in South Austin available August & September 

## Furnished house just 10 minutes from downtown Austin Need a place to stay in Austin this August and September?

Hey, I'm Nicky and this is my wife, Andrea!

We'll be out of Austin for just about all of August and September and we'd love if you made the most of our house here in South Austin in the mean-time.

Here's what you'll love about our place:

- It's just 10 minutes from downtown so you can enjoy the city without living the cramped lifestyle
- 1,200 sq. ft., 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms with a bonus room (in addition to the living room). We just use one bedroom and the other spaces as offices.
- The house is furnished, comfy and super-functional.
- Supa-fast Internet (300 down/20 up from Time Warner and waiting for Google Fiber to be installed)
- We have a nice big backyard that's great for enjoying the sunny Austin days, especially with friends
- Central A/C to fend off the Texas heat plus a whole-house fan if you just want to air out the place
- This is an amazing neighborhood, really close to great restaurants, parks, the supermarket, the gym and more (we'll have tons of recommendations for you).
- **Bus stop across the street** that takes you right downtown in 10 minutes. It's like having your own personal shuttle (round-trip costs $2.50 and can be bought from the CapMetro appâ€”it's so easy!)
